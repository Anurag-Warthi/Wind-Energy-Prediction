# âš¡ Wind Energy Generation Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts wind turbine power output based on windspeed using a trained XGBoost regression model. The user can select a custom date range, and the app uses historical windspeed data from the same months (with realistic noise) to forecast power generation.

## ðŸ§  Features

- WindSpeed: The only feature used to predict ActivePower (power generated by the turbine).
- Data is recorded at 10-minute intervals from January 1, 2018 to March 30, 2020.
- The model learns the relationship between wind speed and energy output and forecasts future energy generation.
- Adds realistic variability to windspeed using standard deviation
- Interactive Streamlit interface
- Forecast displayed as line chart with data export option
